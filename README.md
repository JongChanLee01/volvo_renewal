# Volvo Renewal
안녕하십니까.

공백기동안 잊어버린 것들을 되새김 하기위해서 리액트 기반으로 퍼블리싱을 해보았습니다.
되새김을 하기 위한것이므로 디자인적인 부분은 배제하였습니다.

구글링을 하면서 하였습니다.

  Nav는 map함수와 삼항연산자를 이용하여 만들어보았습니다.
  모델 쪽 부분에서 Electric, Plug-in hybrids, Mild hybrids에 마우스를 가져대 대면 자동차 모델이 바뀌게 하였습니다.

  슬라이드는 slick-slide플러그인을 이용하여 하였습니다.
  
  Volvo Electric 쪽 컨텐츠에 버튼이 하나 있는데 버튼을 누르면 자세히보기 팝업창을 띄우도록 하였습니다.
  이 팝업창에서는 스크롤이 동작하도록 하였습니다.

  탭버튼도 삼항연산자를 이용하여 만들어보았습니다.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
